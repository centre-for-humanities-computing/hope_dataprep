# HOPE Data Preparation
This repository contains up-to-date scripts for Twitter data preparation for the HOPE project.

Previously there have been scripts that would conduct basic preprocessing like tokenisation, lemmatization, and pos-tagging for different nordic languages, but they have been discontinued as end-users always used their own preprocessing pipeline for the particular analysis they had in mind. For these legacy scripts, explore Preprocessing folder in covid19_rbkh repo (beware that it is quite messy in some places).
